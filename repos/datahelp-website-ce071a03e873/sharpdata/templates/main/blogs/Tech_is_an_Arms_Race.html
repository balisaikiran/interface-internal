                        <p>In my last blog post, <a href="https://interface.re/the-holy-grail-of-real-estate-the-all-in-one-data-platform"
                                                    target="blank">The Holy Grail of Real Estate: The All in One Data
                            Platform</a>, I
                            discussed some of the shortcomings of the all-in-one data platforms. In this blog post I'm
                            going to expand on that issue, and offer a solution.
                        </p>

                        <p>It's understandable why the siren call of the all-in-one platform is so seductive. The entire
                            team works from one platform, so no duplicate data entry. Only one platform means less
                            training for sales agents and staff. None of that matters if the platform doesn't work well.
                            The all-in-one platform is a Jack of all trades and a master of none. </p>
                        <p>Let's take a look at the masters of real estate tech, and then we'll get into the solution
                            for the all-in-one dilemma.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="text-center">CRM</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://www.followupboss.com" target="blank">Follow-up-Boss</a> has mastered the
                            real estate CRM, because they focus on being a great CRM. A simple, intuitive interface
                            makes life easy for the sales agents. They've done an amazing job prioritizing leads for
                            agents by using what they call 'Smart Lists.' This allows agents to spend their time
                            following up rather than figuring out who to follow up with. And it makes lead coordination
                            a breeze for staff.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Follow-up-Boss integrates with GMail and Office365. Emails with leads get auto populated to
                            the lead record. Automated lead import, lead assignment, texting, emails, and much more,
                            will cut down on your workload. Set up Action Plans by defining what needs to happen, and
                            when, and let the follow up take care of itself. There's even a dialer. Make calls through
                            the platform and call logging is as simple as possible
                        </p>


                        <h3 class="text-center">IDX Website</h3>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.ylopo.com" target="blank">Ylopo</a> has mastered the IDX niche. Their
                            aim is to be a complete digital marketing solution for real estate teams. Like
                            Follow-up-Boss, they focus on their niche. They don't even have a CRM, so you need to use a
                            CRM they integrate with such as Follow-up-Boss.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ylopo will set you up with an unbranded IDX website that integrates with the MLS. You can
                            also set up a branded website that can be customized using Squarespace.

                        </p>
                        <p>The lead generation is done through Facebook including an effective retargeting solution. The
                            leads flow directly into your CRM. When a lead takes action within the IDX website,
                            notifications are sent to your CRM. This will trigger your agents to reach out and make
                            contact. They even have artificial intelligence based texting that reaches out to leads
                            independently. These 'behavioral texts' are sent when a lead takes certain actions on your
                            home search site.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-center">Transaction Management</h3>
                        <p>When it comes to transaction management, there are a couple of platforms that stand above the
                            rest. Each of these platforms has a niche that it focuses on. Notice a pattern yet?
                        </p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.dotloop.com/" target="blank">Dotloop</a> is great for e-signatures and
                            document management. If you need a platform to maintain a compliant document trail, Dotloop
                            is a great option.
                            The next time your brokerage gets audited doesn’t have to be a stressful situation.
                        </p>

                        <p><a href="https://sisu.co/?rfsn=3566415.c4517" target="blank">SISU</a> focuses more on data
                            tracking and analytics.
                            Conversion ratios, lead source ROI, KPI reports, and sales leaderboards and dashboards are
                            just a few of the things SISU does. If you want to motivate your team, install a flat-screen
                            TV in your office and put a leaderboard on display.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Both Dotloop and SISU have checklists and task management for transaction workflows, so
                            there is some overlap. Smaller teams can likely get by with just one of these platforms.
                            Midsize teams and above will want to add both of these platforms to their tech stack.

                        </p>

                        <h3 class="text-center">All-in-One Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            Other than being focused on their niche, what do each of these platforms have in common?
                            They each have an effective, robust API or Advanced Programming Interface. An API allows a
                            platform to communicate with other platforms. If each of your platforms can communicate with
                            each other, you essentially have one big platform.
                        </p>
                        <p>Your sales team uses Follow-up-Boss. Your marketing team has Ylopo, and your transaction
                            management staff uses Dotloop and/or SISU.
                            Each are highly effective platforms that work together to produce optimal performance.</p>
